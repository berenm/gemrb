Description: Open-source engine to run Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment
 GemRB (Game Engine Made with preRendered Background) is a new implementation
 of the original Infinity Engine (the one of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale,
 Planescape: Torment, ...) to Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows with some
 enhancements.
 .
 It means that you either need some of the original game's data
 somewhere on your harddisk, or you can try to use the data from the
 Dragonlance Total Conversion project.
 .
 The original game data has to be installed on a windows
 partition and mounted to your Linux/Unix filesystem, installed on
 windows and then copied to your filesystem, installed with WINE or
 extracted manually from the CDs using the tool `unshield'.
 .
 Supported games: Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, Planescape:Torment.
