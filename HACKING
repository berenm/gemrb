Where to start
If you don't know what to work on, check out the included TODO file, the FIXMEs 
and TODOs spread throughout the code, the more detailed todo on our wiki at
http://gemrb.org/wiki/doku.php?id=todo or ask either on the forums or IRC.
Alternatively, just start playing one of the games and see what annoys you, 
then start fixing it.
